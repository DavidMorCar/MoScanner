# MoScanner

Tecnologies
- MVVM architecture template with dependency injection.
- Fragments to show that something is loading.
- Dagger2.
- Event bus with JavaRx to change the scan button text, I personally preferred to use livedata to do changes in view reported from the ViewController.

Impediments
- Knowledge of the bluetooth package: I could not use the UUID and get its features.

Building instructions
- If any error or problem appears, you must clean and rebuild the project.
